#### This C++ simulation is an adaptation of the FORTRAN SRAAM6    ####
#### program, which was originally provided for my book            ####
#### "Modeling and Simulation of Aerospace Vehicle Dynamics". For  ####
#### the third Edition it was converted for the CADAC++ framework. ####
#### It is 'Academic Software' and can be used and modified freely ####
#### without warranty. Peter H Zipfel                              ####

* Release 3.1, 25 Oct 2013
	Built with MS Visual C++ 2013

* Features of simulation
	* 6 DoF, flat Earth; local level coordinates: North, East, Down
	* Air-to-air missile:
		aerodynamic tables, functions of Mach and alpha, SRAAM6 data 
		single pulse rocket motor, SRAAM6 data
		autopilot: rate and acceleration
		guidance: compensated pro-nav
		seeker: gimbaled IR seeker 
	* Target is a maneuvering 3 DoF aircraft
	* This simulation is used in it's FORTRAN version in my book 
	* For detailed instructions and derivations of this C++ version, see my
	  Self_Study Course "Fundamentals..." (reference below)

EXECUTION:	* Compile in 'Release' mode
			* Execute with file 'input.asc' located in the projet directory
			* Plot results of output 'plot1.asc' or 'traj.asc' with KPLOT (CADAC/Studio)

OPTIONS:	* aimc11_3.asc Terminal guidance against 3 g target 
			* aimc12_1.asc Missile against evasive target
			* aimc12_2.asc A-pole and F-pole
