#### This C++ simulation is an adaptation of the FORTRAN GHAME6    ####
#### program, which was originally provided for my book            ####
#### "Modeling and Simulation of Aerospace Vehicle Dynamics". For  ####
#### the third Edition it was converted for the CADAC++ framework. ####
#### It is 'Academic Software' and can be used and modified freely ####
#### without warranty. Peter Zipfel                                ####

* * Release 3.1 - 25 Oct 2013
	Built with MS Visual C++ 2013

* Features of GHAME simulation
	* 6 DoF, elliptical Earth, WGS84
	* Hypersonic Vehicle 
		aerodynamic tables, functions of Mach and alpha
		multi-cycle propulsion
		autopilot: rate and acceleration feedback
		midcourse guidance
		GPS and Kalman filter
		star tracker
		with exo-atmospheric, post-boost transfer vehicle with LTG guidance
		with exo-atmospheric interceptor, rendezvous and intercept guidance with seeker
	* 'Satellite' 3 DoF over spherical Earth 
	* 'Radar' fixed ground based 
	* This simulation is used in it's FORTRAN version in my book
	* For detailed derivations and discussion of this C++ version,
	   see my Self-Study Course "Advanced...", below 

EXECUTION:	* Compile in 'Release' mode
			* Execute with file 'input.asc' located in the projet directory
			* Plot results of output 'plot1.asc' or 'traj.asc' with KPLOT (CADAC/Studio)

INPUT FILE:	* input19_3_3.asc: Ascent frome Cape, glidelsope and seeker intercept 
									 			     
PLOTTING:   Install KPLOT from CADAC/Studio (free download from AIAA.org)
